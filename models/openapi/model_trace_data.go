type TraceData struct {

Each character in the Trace ID string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the Trace ID shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the Trace ID shall appear last in the string.

Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit shall appear last in the string. Octets shall be coded according to 3GPP TS 32.422. 
	NeTypeList string `json:"neTypeList" validate:"regexp=^[A-Fa-f0-9]+$"`

	// Triggering events (see 3GPP TS 32.422). It shall be encoded as an octet string in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit shall appear last in the string.

The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the  4 least significant bit shall appear last in the string. Octets shall be coded according to 3GPP TS 32.422. If this attribute is not present, all the interfaces applicable to the list of NE types indicated in the neTypeList attribute should be traced.
