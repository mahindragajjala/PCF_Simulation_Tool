The Globally Unique AMF Identifier (GUAMI) is used to uniquely identify an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) within a 5G network. 

The GUAMI is a key component of the 5G core network architecture.

The GUAMI is made up of the following components: 

Mobile Country Code (MCC)
Mobile Network Code (MNC)
AMF Region ID
AMF Set ID
AMF Pointer


The GUAMI is used in conjunction with the 5G-TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) to identify a user equipment (UE) within an AMF. 

The 5G-TMSI identifies the UE within the AMF that the GUAMI identifies.
