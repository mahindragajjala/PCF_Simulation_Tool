DNN stands for "Data Network Name." 
It is a key concept in 5G network slicing, which allows the creation of multiple virtual networks (slices) on top of a shared physical infrastructure. 
Each slice can have its own unique characteristics, such as different quality of service (QoS), security policies, and network functions. 
The DNN is used to identify and distinguish between these network slices, enabling the 5G core network to properly route and manage traffic based on the requirements of each slice.
