The interface between the UE (User Equipment) and the RAN (Radio Access Network) or gNB in 5G is called the Uu interface.

Uu Interface
Definition: The Uu interface is the air interface, also referred to as the radio interface, that enables communication between the UE and the gNB in 5G.
Protocol Stack: It involves both the control plane and the user plane, and its protocol layers include:
Physical Layer (PHY): Handles radio signal transmission and reception.
MAC (Medium Access Control): Manages data transfer and resource allocation.
RLC (Radio Link Control): Provides segmentation, retransmission, and error correction.
PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol): Handles IP packet compression, encryption, and integrity protection.
NAS (Non-Access Stratum): Contains signaling messages passed directly between the UE and the AMF (via the gNB).

Key Functions of the Uu Interface
Control Plane Communication:


Transfers signaling messages (e.g., registration, mobility management) between the UE and the gNB (relayed to the AMF).
User Plane Communication:


Handles user data traffic, such as internet browsing, video streaming, or voice calls.
Mobility Support:


Facilitates handovers and ensures a seamless transition as the UE moves between different gNBs.
QoS Management:


Supports Quality of Service parameters for different applications.
