1. Registration Phase (UE and AMF)
Step 1: 
The UE (User Equipment) sends a Registration Request to the AMF 
(Access and Mobility Management Function) via the RAN (Radio Access
Network).
This includes UE information like IMSI, supported features, and 
subscription identifiers.


Step 2: 
The AMF authenticates the UE using the AUSF (Authentication Server 
Function) and retrieves subscription details from the UDM (Unified 
Data Management).

Step 3: 
The AMF confirms successful registration to the UE, completing the 
registration process.
Policy Role: Subscription-based policies are retrieved from the UDM 
and passed to the PCF for further action.

2. PDU Session Establishment (UE and SMF)
Step 1: 
The UE sends a PDU (Protocol Data Unit) Session Establishment 
Request to the AMF to establish a data session (e.g., for internet 
access).

Step 2: 
The AMF forwards this request to the SMF (Session Management
Function).
The SMF acts as the anchor for managing the PDU session. 
It assigns an IP address to the UE and determines routing.
  
Policy Role: The SMF interacts with the PCF to retrieve policies 
for the session, such as QoS parameters, traffic rules, and 
charging policies.

3. Policy Decision and Enforcement (PCF)
Step 1: 
The SMF sends a request to the PCF for policies related to the PDU
session.
This includes details like QoS requirements, application type, and 
subscription tier.

Step 2: The PCF generates a policy based on:
Operator-defined rules
Application type (e.g., streaming, gaming)
UE capabilities (e.g., 5G NSA or SA mode)

Step 3: 
The PCF sends the policy rules back to the SMF for 
enforcement.
  
4. Session Setup and Resource Allocation (RAN and UPF)
Step 1: 
The SMF communicates with the RAN and UPF (User Plane Function) to 
allocate the necessary resources for the session.

Step 2: 
The UPF enforces traffic flow rules, QoS, and charging policies as 
defined by the PCF.
Policy Role: The UPF uses rules provided by the SMF and PCF to 
handle traffic prioritization, bandwidth allocation, and routing.
  
5. Data Transmission (UE to Internet)
Step 1: 
The UE begins transmitting data packets to the internet via the RAN 
and UPF.
Step 2:
The RAN ensures that the radio resources are allocated as per the 
QoS policies.
Step 3: 
The UPF routes traffic to the internet and enforces policies 
like throttling, traffic prioritization, and billing.
  
Simplified Call Flow Diagram
UE ↔ RAN ↔ AMF ↔ SMF ↔ PCF ↔ UPF
The key interactions include:
Registration: UE ↔ AMF ↔ AUSF ↔ UDM
PDU Session Setup: UE ↔ AMF ↔ SMF ↔ PCF
Policy Enforcement: SMF ↔ PCF ↔ UPF ↔ RAN

Policy Control Example Use Case
For a video streaming app:
The PCF defines a low latency, high bandwidth policy.
The RAN prioritizes radio resources for the streaming session.
The UPF applies traffic prioritization and enforces QoS policies.
The SMF handles session continuity, ensuring the stream remains 
uninterrupted during handovers.
