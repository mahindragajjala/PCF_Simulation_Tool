A real-time example of the Policy Association ID in a 
5G network can be explained using a scenario 
where a user is consuming both standard mobile data and 
video streaming services simultaneously.

Scenario:
Let’s say a 5G mobile user is using their device for two different types of services:
Browsing the internet (standard data usage)
Streaming a high-definition (HD) video (high bandwidth and low latency requirements)


Step-by-Step Example:
Session Setup:
When the user connects to the 5G network, the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) 
initiates the process of establishing a session.
The SMF (Session Management Function) creates the session, and the PCF (Policy Control Function) 
is involved to apply relevant policies to control network usage and resources.


Assigning Policy Rules:
The PCF retrieves different policies based on the service the user is accessing. For example:
For standard data usage, the network might assign a lower QoS (Quality of Service) 
profile with average speed.
For video streaming, the network might assign a higher QoS with low latency and higher bandwidth.


Policy Association ID:
The PCF generates a Policy Association ID for each type of service that the user 
is using. Let’s assume:
The Policy Association ID 1 is for the browsing session, which has standard QoS.
The Policy Association ID 2 is for the video streaming session, which has higher QoS and priority.


Session Management:
Each Policy Association ID links the policies to the respective service flows. 
The SMF uses these Policy Association IDs to apply the appropriate policies 
when managing the user’s data traffic:
For traffic linked to Policy Association ID 1, it enforces the standard data policy.
For traffic linked to Policy Association ID 2, it applies the video streaming policy, 
ensuring higher bandwidth and low latency.

Dynamic Policy Changes:
Let’s say the user starts downloading a large file. 
In real-time, the PCF may dynamically adjust the policy for the 
video streaming session (Policy Association ID 2) to reduce bandwidth 
if the network becomes congested.
Similarly, if the user switches from HD to SD video streaming, the PCF might lower
the QoS requirements for the streaming session (adjusting Policy Association ID 2), 
while possibly increasing the QoS for the file download (Policy Association ID 1).


Charging and Billing:
The Policy Association IDs also play a role in tracking the usage of each service for charging purposes. 
The network can accurately monitor and charge for different types of services, such as:
Standard browsing data (lower cost).
High-definition video streaming (higher cost due to higher bandwidth and QoS requirements).


Benefits of Policy Association ID:
                            Granular Control: The Policy Association ID allows the network to 
                            apply specific policies to different services (browsing vs. v
                            ideo streaming), ensuring that each service gets the right 
                            level of resources and treatment.


Flexibility: 
            The system can dynamically adjust policies based on real-time network conditions 
            (e.g., congestion, network priority).


Efficient Resource Management: 
            By using distinct IDs for different services, the network can ensure optimal resource 
            allocation and manage traffic flows more efficiently.


Conclusion:
In this scenario, the Policy Association ID enables the network to differentiate 
between the user's browsing and video streaming activities, applying the appropriate 
policies and resources for each. It helps in managing traffic, ensuring a high-quality 
experience for services like video streaming while optimizing the network for standard data usage.
