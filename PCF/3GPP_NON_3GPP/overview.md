In 5G, 3GPP access refers to networks that follow 3GPP standards like 5G NR (New Radio) and LTE, while non-3GPP access includes Wi-Fi, satellite, or private networks that do not follow 3GPP standards but can still connect to the 5G core.
Example:
3GPP Access: 5G NR, LTE (cellular networks)
Non-3GPP Access: Wi-Fi, satellite networks, private 5G networks
Key Difference (One Line): 3GPP access follows 3GPP-defined cellular standards (5G NR, LTE), while non-3GPP access includes external networks like Wi-Fi or satellites connecting to the 5G core.
