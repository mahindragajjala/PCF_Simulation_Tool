It shall be possible for the PCC framework to base decisions upon subscription information, Access Type and the RAT Type.

The PCC framework shall perform Gating Control and discard packets that don't match any service data flow of the active PCC rules. 

It shall also be possible for the operator to define PCC rules, with wild-carded service data flow filters, to allow sending or receiving packets that do not match any service data flow template of any other active PCC rules.

The PCC framework shall allow the charging control to be applied on a per service data flow and on a per application basis, independent of the policy control.


The PCC framework shall have a binding method that allows the unique association between service data flows and specific QoS Flow.

A single service data flow detection shall suffice for the purpose of both policy control and flow based charging.

A PCC rule may be predefined or dynamically provisioned at establishment and during the lifetime of a PDU Session.

The latter is referred to as a dynamic PCC rule.

It shall be possible to take a PCC rule into service, and out of service, at a specific time of day, without any PCC interaction at that point in time.

It shall be possible to take DNN-related policy information into service, and out of service, once validity conditions specified as part of the DNN-related policy information are fulfilled or not fulfilled anymore, respectively, without any PCC interaction at that point in time.

PCC shall be enabled on a per DNN basis at the SMF. 

It shall be possible for the operator to configure the PCC framework to perform charging control, policy control or both for a DNN access.

The PCC framework shall allow the resolution of conflicts which would otherwise cause a subscriber's Subscribed Guaranteed Bandwidth QoS to be exceeded.

It should be possible to use PCC framework for handling IMS-based emergency service.

It shall be possible with the PCC framework, in real-time, to monitor the overall amount of resources that are consumed by a user and to control usage independently from charging mechanisms, the so-called usage monitoring control.

It shall be possible for the PCC framework to provide application awareness even when there is no explicit service level signalling.

The PCC framework shall support making policy decisions based on subscriber spending limits.

The PCC framework shall support making policy decisions for N6 traffic steering.
