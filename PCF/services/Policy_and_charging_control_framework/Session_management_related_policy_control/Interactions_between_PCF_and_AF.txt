Interactions between PCF and AF 


Npcf and Naf enable transport of application level session information and Ethernet port management information from AF to PCF. 
Application Level Session Information (ALSI) in 5G refers to session-specific data about an application (e.g., QoS, bandwidth, latency needs) that helps the network optimize performance, resource allocation, and policy enforcement.
Such information includes, but is not limited to:
- IP filter information or Ethernet packet filter information to identify the service data flow for policy control and/or differentiated charging;
- Media/application bandwidth requirements for QoS control;
- In addition, for sponsored data connectivity:
- the sponsor's identification;
- optionally, a usage threshold and whether the PCF reports these events to the AF;
- information identifying the application service provider and application (e.g. SDFs, application identifier,etc.);
- information required to enable Application Function influence on traffic routing as defined in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2];
- information required to enable setting up an AF session with required QoS as defined in clause 6.1.3.22.
- information required to enable setting up an AF session with support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined in clause 6.1.3.23.

Npcf and Naf enable the AF subscription to notifications on PDU Session events, i.e. the events requested by the AF as described in clause 6.1.3.18 and the change of DNAI as defined in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
The N5 reference point is defined for the interactions between PCF and AF in the reference point representation.

- Provision of DNN replacement decision from the PCF to the AMF;
- Deletion of an UE Policy Association as defined in clause 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3];

Interactions between V-PCF and H-PCF

For roaming scenario, the interactions between V-PCF and H-PCF through Npcf enables:
- Creation of an UE Policy Association as defined in clause 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3];
- Relay of notification of changes from the V-PCF in the VPLMN to the H-PCF as defined in clause 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3];
- Provision of UE access selection and PDU Session selection related policies to the V-PCF in the VPLMN;

Interactions between PCF and UDR


The Nudr enables the PCF to access policy control related subscription information and application specific information stored in the UDR. 

The Nudr interface supports the following functions:

- Request for policy control related subscription information and application specific information from the UDR.

- Provisioning of policy control related subscription information and application specific information to the UDR.

- Notifications from the UDR on changes in the policy control related subscription information.

- Subscription to the UDR for the AF requests targeting a DNN and S-NSSAI or a group of UEs (roaming UEs for LBO case) identified by an Internal Group Identifier.

- Notifications from the UDR on the update of AF requests targeting a DNN and S-NSSAI or a group of UEs (roaming UEs for LBO case) identified by an Internal Group Identifier.

Interactions between SMF and CHF

The interactions between SMF and CHF enable online and offline charging.
The N40 reference point is defined for the interactions between SMF and CHF in the reference point representation.
Since the N40 reference point resides between the SMF and CHF in the HPLMN, home routed roaming and non-roaming scenarios are supported in the same manner.
NOTE: The functionality of this interface/reference point is defined in TS 32.240 [8].

Interactions between PCF and CHF
