Charging related requirements

In order to allow for charging control on service data flow, the information in the PCC rule identifies the service data flow and specifies the parameters for charging control.
For the purpose of charging correlation between service data flow level and application level (e.g. IMS) as well as online charging support at the application level, applicable charging identifiers and Access Type identifiers shall be passed from the PCF to the AF, if such identifiers are available.
