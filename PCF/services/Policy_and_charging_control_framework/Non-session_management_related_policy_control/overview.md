WHAT  IS  MEAN BY THE NON-SESSION MANAGEMENT ?

Non-Session Management in 5G refers to handling tasks like registration, mobility, and policy control that donâ€™t involve managing active data sessions.
In 5G, data sessions refer to the connections established between a user's device (UE) and the network to enable the transfer of data, such as internet browsing, video streaming, or app usage, through a Packet Data Unit (PDU) session.
