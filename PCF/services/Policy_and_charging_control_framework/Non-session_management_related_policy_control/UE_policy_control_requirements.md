The 5GC shall be able to provide policy information from the PCF to the UE. 

Such policy information includes:

- Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP): It is used by the UE for selecting non-3GPP access networks.

- UE Route Selection Policy (URSP): This policy is used by the UE to determine how to route outgoing traffic.

Traffic can be routed to an established PDU Session, can be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session, or can trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session.

- V2X Policy (V2XP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE for V2X communication over PC5 reference point or over Uu reference point or both. 

V2X Policies are defined in TS 23.287 [28].
