Management of Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) refers to the capability to create, update or remove PFDs in the NEF(PFDF) and the distribution from the NEF (PFDF) to the SMF and finally to the UPF. 

This feature may be used when the UPF is configured to detect a particular application provided by an ASP.

NOTE 1: A possible scenario for the management of PFDs in the SMF is when an application, identified by an application detection filter in the UPF, deploys a new server or a reconfiguration occurs in the ASP network which impacts the application detection filters of that particular application.

NOTE 2: The management of application detection filters in the SMF can still be performed by using operation and maintenance procedures.

NOTE 3: This feature aims for both: to enable accurate application detection at the UPF and to minimize storage requirements for the UPF and the SMF.

The management of PFDs is supported in non-roaming and home-routed scenarios for those ASPs that have a business relation with the home operator.
