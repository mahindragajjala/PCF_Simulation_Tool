For the authorization of a PCC rule the PCF shall consider any 5GC specific restrictions, subscription information and other information available to the PCF. 
Each PCC rule receives a set of QoS parameters that are supported by the specific Access Network. 
The authorization of a PCC rule associated with an emergency service shall be supported without subscription information.
The PCF shall apply local policies configured for the emergency service.
