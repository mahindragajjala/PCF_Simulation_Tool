The Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for SMF define the conditions when the SMF shall interact again with PCF after a PDU Session establishment as defined in the Session Management Policy Establishment and Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.502 [3].


The PCR triggers are not applicable any longer at termination of the SM Policy Association.
The access independent Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for SMF are listed in table 6.1.3.5-1.

The differences with table 6.2 and table A.4.3-2 in TS 23.203 [4] are shown, either "none" means that the parameter applies in 5GS or "removed" meaning that the parameter does not apply in 5GS, this is due to the lack of support in the 5GS for this feature or "modified" meaning that the parameter applies with some modifications defined in the parameter.
