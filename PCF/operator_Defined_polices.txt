1. Access Network Selection Policies (ANDSP):
    Determines which access network (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) 
    the UE should use based on operator preferences and 
    network conditions.


2. Policy and Charging Rules (PCR):
      Enforced by the Policy Control Function (PCF) to manage QoS 
      (Quality of Service) and charging for specific traffic flows.

3. Network Slicing Policies:
Assign users to specific network slices (e.g., enhanced mobile 
broadband, ultra-reliable low-latency communication, or massive IoT)
based on their needs and operator-defined SLAs (Service Level 
Agreements).

4. Roaming Policies:
Define access and restrictions for users roaming on other operators' 
networks, including handling of preferred roaming partners and 
access technologies.

5. Traffic Steering Policies:
  Directs traffic to specific paths or networks (e.g., 5G NR or Wi-Fi) 
  to optimize performance or reduce costs.

6. Idle Mode Mobility Policies:
      Specifies criteria for UE mobility when in idle mode (e.g., 
      deciding when to hand over between cells or RATs).

7. QoS Management Policies:
    Define the priority, latency, and bandwidth requirements for 
    specific services or applications, ensuring an optimal user 
    experience.

8. Offloading Policies:
  Enables traffic offloading to unlicensed spectrum (e.g., Wi-Fi) to 
  reduce congestion on licensed 5G networks.

9. Application-Specific Policies:
  Policies tailored for specific applications, such as AR/VR, video 
  streaming, or gaming, to ensure appropriate latency and bandwidth.

10. Security and Access Control Policies:
  Defines authentication, encryption, and other security measures for
  accessing the 5G network.

11. Power Saving Policies:
      Includes UE power-saving modes and network configurations to 
      optimize battery life while maintaining connectivity.

12. Data Usage and Throttling Policies:
    Controls data consumption by applying caps or throttling speeds 
    after usage thresholds are reached.
